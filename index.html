        <h1>Lacrosse Game</h1>
        <h3>Version 2.0</h3>
        <br>

        <p>This is the second complete version of a lacrosse video game. The game is currently in development - more info will be provided here as it's available.</p>
        <br>

        <p>This game is a text-based game which allows you to play two teams of fictional players against each other. The game will show each event as it plays out in the game, as well as the final score once the game is over.</p>
        <p>The game will eventually play an entire season, putting you in the GM seat of your favorite lacrosse team, and allowing you to make moves to lead your team to the championship. This is still in development.</p>
