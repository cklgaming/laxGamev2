        <h1>Roadmap</h1>
        <sub>This page shows our complete development plan for the lacrosse video game, in anticipated order. This map will be updated regularly and is subject to change.</sub>
        <br>

        <dl>
            <dd>Add CSS to website</dd>
            <dt>This is the next move in the process. As I'm learning programming on the fly, I planned to learn HTML, CSS, then JavaScript.</dt>

            <dd>Add JavaScript to website</dd>
            <dt>This is the last step before the actual game development begins. I want to begin by applying basic JavaScript to the website before moving on to game dev.</dt>
            <dt>This includes changing the contact page to include a contact form for emailing us, along with some better-looking parts of each site.</dt>

            <dd>Begin game development - Start with single-possession simulation</dd>
            <dt>The plan here is to start small with a single-possession simulator, which will only simulate the result of one possession at a time, with no score kept.</dt>
            <dt>This allows us to make sure all of the small details of the game work well, like the game "state" (how the game knows what to do at what time), and how the players interact with one another.</dt>

            <dd>Continue game development - Expand on simulation, full game</dd>
            <dt>After we're sure the initial iteration of the game works as intended, we can expand to keep score and to create a simulation which runs an entire game.</dt>
            <dt>This iteration will keep score and simulate each possession all as a part of one game. During this time, we'll continue to test and develop the game and simulation logic accordingly.</dt>

            <dd>Implement frontend, backend, and database</dd>
            <dt>As I mentioned earlier, I'm learning to program a game on the fly. I don't want to learn anything else until I have the ability to implement it in the game effectively, so we'll wait to create the frontend, backend, and database until we're ready to create a full game.</dt>
            <dt>We will then implement each of these individual frameworks, one at a time, before we continue with any more game development.</dt>

            <dd>Continue game development - Put games together to simulate full season</dd>
            <dt>This is where the fun comes in. We're putting everything together in order to create the full game. You finally get to hop in the GM's chair and make all of the moves to take your team to the championship.</dt>

            <dd>Continue to test and develop game</dd>
            <dt>We're committed to continuing to develop the best game for you day in and day out, which means we never stop adding features, squashing bugs, and making sure this game is the best on the market for you to play.</dt>

            <dd>Move off web to desktop/mobile</dd>
            <dt>This is by far the most difficult part of the entire development process. We want to move everything off of the web and allow you to play this game on your desktop, on your phone or tablet, and take it with you wherever you go.</dt>
            <dt>Now, this doesn't mean the game won't still exist on your browser. It will, but it will receive much less frequent updates and stay as an offline version of the game.</dt>

            <dd>Add visual graphics</dd>
            <dt>Did you think we wanted this game to stay text-based? We like watching the game unfold, just like we know you do. The plan is to start with a 2D rendering of the game, and then hopefully moving to a 3D model soon.</dt>
            <dt>However, nothing about graphic-based interfaces is going to be "soon". This is probably going to take the longest time to implement - like, a few years. But, like I said, we're committed to giving you the best possible lacrosse game for you to play and enjoy.</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, this list is very much still a work-in-progress. We'll be going into more detail soon, once we figure out exactly how we want to go about this process. We'll also be adding and deleting points on this map as we go and the future becomes more clear.</p>
